//! Android platform bridge for rinch.
//!
//! Provides JNI infrastructure for calling Android platform APIs from Rust.
//! Each module wraps a specific platform service (clipboard, IME, etc.)
//! and calls methods on `RinchActivity.java` via JNI.
//!
//! # Initialization
//!
//! Call [`init`] once from `android_main` before using any service:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! rinch_android::init(&android_app);
//! ```
//!
//! # Minimum API level
//!
//! This crate assumes **API 28** (Android 9). Nothing declares it — the floor
//! comes from `examples/hello-android`'s `AndroidManifest.xml` and
//! `build-apk.sh`, both of which say `minSdk 28` — so a downstream app is free
//! to ship lower. Below 28 the calls that branch on `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`
//! take their oldest path or become no-ops rather than failing:
//! `display::set_light_status_bars` and `display::set_light_navigation_bars`
//! write system-UI visibility flags that API 21–25 frameworks simply ignore, so
//! the bars keep the system's default light-on-dark contents. (Plain code
//! spans, not intra-doc links: those modules are
//! `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`, so the paths do not resolve when the docs
//! are built on the host, which is where CI builds them.)
//!
//! # What compiles on the host
//!
//! Most modules here are `#[cfg(target_os = "android")]` in their entirety: they
//! are JNI wrappers with nothing to say off-device. The four that hold a
//! **callback registry** — [`callback`], [`lifecycle`], [`location`],
//! [`sensors`] — are not. Their registries, drains and scope-lifetime rules (see
//! `scoped`) compile and are unit-tested on every CI machine, and only the JNI
//! half of each operation sits behind the `cfg`, as a small private function
//! that is a no-op off-device. [`screen`] takes the same split for a different
//! structure — a refcounted guard rather than a registry — so its edges are
//! host-tested too. [`display_decode`] takes it for a third: not a registry or
//! a guard but a *contract*, the arithmetic that says what each of `display`'s
//! JNI getters returns, lifted out so the rule is checked on the side that
//! implements it and not only on the side that states it. Nothing in this
//! repository builds an APK in CI, so logic left behind the `cfg` is logic
//! nothing checks (issue #183 PR5).
//!
//! `RinchActivity.java` is worse off still: no build in this repository
//! compiles it, so a syntax error there passes every check we have (issue
//! #516). `tests/java_contract_tests.rs` is the narrow answer — host-compiled
//! assertions about that file's *source text*, for the few details whose loss
//! is silent at every other layer. It cannot tell you the Java works; it can
//! tell you that, say, the content-URI writer still opens a truncating stream.
//! Add to it sparingly, and only where a compile error and a device would both
//! stay quiet.
