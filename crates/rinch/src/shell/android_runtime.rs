/// producer; creating a Vulkan swapchain connects it to
/// `NATIVE_WINDOW_API_EGL`. Building both and picking one at runtime would
/// mean the loser of that race silently failing every frame, so the choice is
/// made by the compiler and only one of them exists.

/// used to go through `softbuffer`, which is the right abstraction on the
/// desktop — one API over X11, Wayland, Win32 and the rest — and the wrong one
/// here, because Android is the platform where softbuffer cannot map the
/// window's memory into the caller's hands. Its Android backend keeps a shadow
/// `Vec<Pixel>` the size of the screen, allocates and zeroes a fresh one on
/// every `next_buffer()`, lets the caller fill *that*, and then copies it a
/// byte at a time into the locked window buffer on `present()`. Every frame
/// therefore paid for a 10.6 MB allocation and two full-screen copies where
/// one would do.
///
/// Card K27 measured the three phases on a moto g stylus 5G at 1080x2460,
/// with a temporary `log::info!` probe around each — the technique K24 used —
/// before and after this rewrite:
///
/// ```text
///                     acquire   fill   swap    total
/// through softbuffer      4.1    2.9    5.2     12.2
/// into the window         0.5    2.0    0.6      3.1
/// ```
///
/// `acquire` is the allocate-and-zero, `fill` is this function's own copy, and
/// `swap` is handing the buffer to the compositor. So only about a quarter of
/// the ~12ms was the copy this file controls; the rest was the shadow buffer
/// existing at all. That mattered more than it sounds: on a
/// screen that is scrolling with momentum the painter returns its cached
/// pixmap untouched and nothing is redrawn, so those 12ms *were* the entire
/// frame — 298 of the 318 frames in K27's library-scroll trace repainted
/// nothing and cost 13.3ms each anyway. After the rewrite the same trace's
/// unchanged frames cost 6.4ms, and the loop presents about 30% more of them
/// in the same wall-clock window — the residue is `ANativeWindow_lock`
/// blocking for a free buffer, which is the display's back-pressure and not
/// work.
///
/// Writing into the window directly gives up nothing here. The one thing a
/// shadow buffer buys is the ability to leave pixels alone between frames,
/// and this shell never does: `build_pixels` hands back a complete frame every

/// **This struct exists because of when things die.** A Vulkan device, and the
/// twenty-odd compute pipelines vello compiles against it, belong to the
/// process: nothing Android does to an Activity invalidates them. A swapchain
/// belongs to the `ANativeWindow`, and Android destroys that window every time
/// the Activity is stopped — every press of Home, every task switch, every
/// screen rotation on some devices. Those are different lifetimes, so they are
/// different structs, and the loop holds one binding for each.
///
/// The version of this file that read the frame back to the CPU had no
/// swapchain and therefore no reason to make the distinction: it kept device
/// and target in one `GpuSurface` and dropped the lot on `TerminateWindow`.
/// Doing that now would recompile vello's pipeline set on every resume, and
/// the logcat timestamps say what that costs. On a moto g stylus 5G, cold:

/// from a compute shader. A swapchain image is a colour attachment, and on
/// Android — as on most drivers — it is not usable as a storage image, so
/// vello cannot be pointed at it. `render_to_texture` therefore draws into
/// `target`, an `Rgba8Unorm` storage texture the size of the window, and a
/// full-screen triangle then samples that into the swapchain image in the
/// format the display asked for. Vello's own `util` module does exactly this
/// and its documentation is explicit that the alternative — handing vello the
/// swapchain texture when the driver happens to allow it — "should generally
/// be avoided, as some GPUs assume that you will not be rendering to the
/// surface using a compute pipeline, and optimise accordingly".
///
/// The blit costs one texture read and one write per pixel, entirely on the
/// GPU. What it replaces is the readback this path used to do: a
/// `copy_texture_to_buffer` into mappable memory, a blocking wait for it, and
/// a row-by-row CPU copy to strip wgpu's 256-byte row padding — 50 to 69ms per

/// **What is left is not this file.** Frame-to-frame, the same traces measure

/// from "the readback" to "the loop's own clock", which is a different card.
///
/// Card **K37** is that card, and it changes how the numbers above should be
/// read. The loop no longer sleeps between frames, so the wait it used to do in

/// 12.5 / 31.1 / 4.9ms, which on the first two is the queue refusing another
/// frame rather than work appearing from nowhere. The PDF's 4.9 is the useful
/// control: its whole paint is 22.2ms, so seventeen of those milliseconds are
/// `build_scene` and `render_to_texture` and no amount of pacing will move
/// them. Frame-to-frame — the number that is about the user and not about this
/// file — went to 16.3 / 40.9 / 23.0. See `android_frame::poll_timeout` for
/// both halves of that table.
///
/// **Card K42 then asked why the library frame lands on every second vsync,

/// **empty** scene still costs 4.19ms of GPU, which is half the 120Hz budget
/// spent before anything is drawn, and the real scene costs 17.4; at half
/// scale the same scene costs 8.06. So roughly 5ms of the frame is fixed and
/// 12ms is per-pixel work in vello's fine stage, and the road to 120fps on
/// this handset runs through one of those two numbers, not through anything
/// on this page.
///
/// **The blit is the one suspect that did cost something, and it cannot be
/// removed at this pin.** Its device-side cost — as opposed to the 0.04ms to
/// encode it — is most of the 1.6ms above: a full-screen read and write of
/// 2.66 million pixels. This window would allow it to go: `get_capabilities` answers
/// `usages=COPY_SRC | COPY_DST | TEXTURE_BINDING | STORAGE_BINDING |
/// RENDER_ATTACHMENT | STORAGE_ATOMIC` and offers `Rgba8Unorm`, which is
/// exactly what vello's fine stage wants to write. Configuring the surface
/// that way and handing vello the swapchain view compiles, runs, logs `vello
/// writes the swapchain image` — and then panics on the first frame with
/// `Device::create_bind_group: The adapter does not support write access for
/// storage textures of format Rgba8Unorm`, which is not true of this adapter.
/// It is true of wgpu: `wgpu-core`'s `present.rs` builds every surface
/// texture with `format_features.allowed_usages =
/// TextureUsages::RENDER_ATTACHMENT` and a `flags` set containing only the
/// two multisample bits, hard-coded, whatever the surface advertised. So no
/// swapchain image is bindable as a storage texture in wgpu 27 and vello can
/// never write one, on any driver. That is a wgpu change, not a rinch one,
/// and it is worth something like a millisecond and a half of a 17.4ms frame
/// if it ever lands — which is not the difference between 58fps and 120, but
